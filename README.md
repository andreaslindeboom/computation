# Understanding Computation
This repository contains some code experiments inspired by the book [Understanding Computation] (http://computationbook.com) by Tom Stuart. I have written them purely to help me understand the book better and should in no way be considered production ready.

Just to make it extra clear: this code is horrible! No code quality, SOLID principles or any good practices were considered while writing it. Do NOT use it **except** for learning about abstract machines!

## Small Step Semantics
The first and (likely) simplest implementation in the book. Allows you to build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) leading back to a single ancestor. The machine will then start and keep reducing the
